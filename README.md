Question 2 of homework 2

Author Information - Tanmay Mandot - MSAFA student - 2nd year  

**Description of problems:**   

First is a web crawler for crisis press releases on the **UN** website  
Second is the code for a web crawler for crisis press releases in the **EU** website  
I have also added the web crawler covered in class  


I am not sure what changes were required, so i basically had uploaded a draft version of my code(the one where i was getting only two press releases) and then updated it with the new version (the one where i figured out how to iterate over page numbers)
